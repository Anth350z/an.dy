    "\n",
    "Advanced sports visualization is a perfect excercise of using pandas, seaborn and other advanced techniques in Python for json data sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "I would use Python (pandas, seaborn and possibly flask/dash or other visualization techniques such as plotly, whichever works best)."
